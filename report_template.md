# Project Description
Recycled Corp is a world leader in recycling and we have just conducted a
study in why people are not recycling. Our idea is an application that can
help people to scan products via barcode (Or type it in) and see which
products can be recycled, how and where to recycle them. We also want to
reward the user for recycling so some nice messages would be good!

The application will be called Recycle Rush and will target Android versions
4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and later. The primary programming language will
be Java.

The continuous integration builds cab be found at https://travis-ci.org/IT-Kakan/adp_project

## Reflections
There is not much to reflect on, as this was not a typical development sprint. We met for the first time and set up the basis for the project. We were successful in splitting the work between us and managed to complete all assigned tasks.

Given the atypical nature of this sprint, we have chosen to not reflect on agile practices. However, we have made knowledge transfer within the group, as we had different experiance on setting up of the basis of the project.

# Sprint 2 Log

## Commitment
* The group attended the acceptance test and sprint retrospective for the last sprint.
* We estimated the story points for each feature in sprint 2's backlog using planning poker.

We completed the following user stories

* ID: 1. As a customer I instantly want to be prompted with the camera on my phone so that I can scan items (Estimate: 4 pts)
* ID: 2. As a user I want to see what products that can be recycled so that I can recycle properly (Estimate: 7 pts)
* ID: 3. As a user I want to scan at least two different item/product so that I can get information about them in the application (Estimate: 7 pts)

## Reflections

We had three group meetings in this sprint that were about two hours long each. The team work seems to improve, as there was a lot of communication on the tasks and team members that were done with their task tried to helped the others with theirs. However we noticed that it is hard to find meeting times where everybody is available.

The team velocity were quite inaccurate this sprint. All the group members finished quite fast with each task. After the acceptance test 1 we talked with our product owner(Magnus), about what he expects after the upcoming sprint. He gave us the minimum requirements for the sprint, and this made us estimated the work to be done, in a way of the "demands" of Magnus. Throughout the sprint we realised that this is the wrong way to go, since our estimations were a reflection of Magnus demands. For the upcoming sprint we will estimate a set of task before meeting with Magnus, to gain a better overview of what the group actually are able to achieve in one sprint.

Mahshid and Emil experienced pair-programming in our group and it took 4 hours to complete task. Moreover, Johan and Kalayu also partly applied extreme programming agile practices while applying an API for our barcode scanner feature. One positive aspect of this practice was knowledge transfering because we have this chance that one act as a observer and monitored the driver's code in order to collaburate regularly and switched the role at any time. However, we experience some difficulties in time management.

# Sprint 3 Log

## Commitment
* The group attended the acceptance test and sprint retrospective for the last sprint.
* We estimated the story points for most of the features in sprint 3's backlog using planning poker.

We completed the following user stories

* ID: 4. As a user I want to input the barcode in text format so that I can get information about it in the application (Estimate: 2 pts)
* ID: 5. Create local users
* ID: 6.
* ID: 7. As a user I want to see where I can recycle the scanned product so that I know where to recycle it (Estimate: * pts)
* ID: 8.
* ID: 9.
* ID: 10. Display user information
## Work Done
Log what was accomplished, and how.
Please report on all activities; for example, in addition to coding, planning and design discussion.

## Reflections
Reflect on how the work worked.
This data will form the basis for your final reflection.
As the postmortem will be a writeup, it's fine to use shorthand notes, bullet list, and similar.
Keep within 1000-1500 words.

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

Reflect on the agile practice practiced:

Jesper and Emil experienced pair-programming in our group, this was necessary since our tasks were closely related. We think it was more effective to do it as a pair, since both knew what had been done on each part.

- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- How did the practices interact?
  Did they complement or counteract each other?

- How efficient were the practices, given the time they took to use?

Early in the sprint, we realised that we have difficulties with writing the report. The previous hand-ins have been completed on the final day, which results in us not properly reviewing the document. This became apparent with the report for sprint 2, where we after submission deadline detected errors thought to arise from text integration problems. As other issues have been more pressing this sprint, we have not reflected much on how to address this issue. While our process likely can be improved, it also feels like the current setup (at least partially) works against us. At least when compared to working at a company, our work schedule is quite ad-hoc. This makes time tracking difficult, especially since we are supposed to report on each activity. In addition, we read different courses, which results in us being split up and everyone has to keep track of their own time, what practices they used and their reflection of these. Naturally, this makes it difficult to synthesise the report. Finally, we feel that there is very little motivation for writing the report. It is administrative overhead and often feels like a chore that provide no real benefit.

The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.

Considering the following:

- With regards to the agile practices, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?


# Project outcome
Document the project, for example using screenshots.
