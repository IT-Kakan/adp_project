# Project Description
Recycled Corp is a world leader in recycling and we have just conducted a
study in why people are not recycling. Our idea is an application that can
help people to scan products via barcode (Or type it in) and see which
products can be recycled, how and where to recycle them. We also want to
reward the user for recycling so some nice messages would be good!

The application will be called Recycle Rush and will target Android versions
4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and later. The primary programming language will
be Java.

The git repository can be found at https://github.com/IT-Kakan/adp_project

The issue tracker can be found at https://trello.com/b/xZWxyu2J/agile-development-processes

The continuous integration builds cab be found at https://travis-ci.org/IT-Kakan/adp_project

## Reflections
There is not much to reflect on, as this was not a typical development sprint. We met for the first time and set up the basis for the project. We were successful in splitting the work between us and managed to complete all assigned tasks.

Given the atypical nature of this sprint, we have chosen to not reflect on agile practices. However, we have made knowledge transfer within the group, as we had different experiance on setting up of the basis of the project.

# Sprint 2 Log

## Commitment
* The group attended the acceptance test and sprint retrospective for the last sprint.
* We estimated the story points for each feature in sprint 2's backlog using planning poker.

We completed the following user stories

* ID: 1. As a customer I instantly want to be prompted with the camera on my phone so that I can scan items (Estimate: 4 pts)
* ID: 2. As a user I want to see what products that can be recycled so that I can recycle properly (Estimate: 7 pts)
* ID: 3. As a user I want to scan at least two different item/product so that I can get information about them in the application (Estimate: 7 pts)

## Reflections

We had three group meetings in this sprint that were about two hours long each. The team work seems to improve, as there was a lot of communication on the tasks and team members that were done with their task tried to helped the others with theirs. However we noticed that it is hard to find meeting times where everybody is available.

The team velocity were quite inaccurate this sprint. All the group members finished quite fast with each task. After the acceptance test 1 we talked with our product owner(Magnus), about what he expects after the upcoming sprint. He gave us the minimum requirements for the sprint, and this made us estimated the work to be done, in a way of the "demands" of Magnus. Throughout the sprint we realised that this is the wrong way to go, since our estimations were a reflection of Magnus demands. For the upcoming sprint we will estimate a set of task before meeting with Magnus, to gain a better overview of what the group actually are able to achieve in one sprint.

Mahshid and Emil experienced pair-programming in our group and it took 4 hours to complete task. Moreover, Johan and Kalayu also partly applied extreme programming agile practices while applying an API for our barcode scanner feature. One positive aspect of this practice was knowledge transfering because we have this chance that one act as a observer and monitored the driver's code in order to collaburate regularly and switched the role at any time. However, we experience some difficulties in time management.

# Sprint 3 Log

## Commitment
* The group attended the acceptance test and sprint retrospective for the last sprint.
* We estimated the story points for most of the features in sprint 3's backlog using planning poker.

We committed to the following user stories

* ID: 4. As a user I want to input the barcode in text format so that I can get information about it in the application.
* ID: 5. Create local users.
* ID: 6. Configure the test-environment, and write a sample test.
* ID: 7. As a user I want to see where I can recycle the scanned product so that I know where to recycle it.
* ID: 8. As a user I want to navigate through the app so that I can view different views.
* ID: 9. fix scanning of barcode.
* ID: 10. Display user information.

We failed to complete the following user stories

* ID: 6.

## Reflections
Jesper and Emil experienced pair-programming in our group, this was necessary since their tasks were closely related. We think it was more effective to do it as a pair, since both knew what had been done on each part.

When planning the sprint, we realised that we wanted to practice test-first. It sounds quite promising in theory, but we wanted some more practical experience. This is what ID 6 was about and as can be seen from the low estimate, we thought it should be quite straightforward to set up test suites for Travis to execute. Indeed, we understand this as one of the main purposes for the software. In spite of this, we were unable to complete the task within the allocated time. We were able to find neither sufficient documentation or tutorials and many of the solutions suggested on the web fell short. From what we gather, we must execute steps that the Travis team claim "are not fully supported by Travis CI Android builder." While it simply could be that we're missing something obvious, we never-the-less feel that we have not got enough instruction in how to use Travis, despite it being mandatory in the course.

Early in the sprint, we realised that we have difficulties with writing the report. The previous hand-ins have been completed on the final day, which results in us not properly reviewing the document. This became apparent with the report for sprint 2, where we after submission deadline detected errors thought to arise from text integration problems. As other issues have been more pressing this sprint, we have not reflected much on how to address this issue. While our process likely can be improved, it also feels like the current setup (at least partially) works against us. At least when compared to working at a company, our work schedule is quite ad-hoc. This makes time tracking difficult, especially since we are supposed to report on each activity. In addition, we read different courses, which results in us being split up and everyone has to keep track of their own time, what practices they used and their reflection of these. Naturally, this makes it difficult to synthesise the report. Finally, we feel that there is very little motivation for writing the report. It is administrative overhead and often feels like a chore that provide no real benefit.

After the project has grown over the last sprints, it made sense to think about refactoring the code. Two major things have been done in the process of refactoring. One was to check whether the coding style that the team decided on has been used at all time. This change was rather small as the coding style was mainly applied. A bigger change was made in the apps main activity, which we found to be a bit more challenging. Since everyone is working in or using the apps main activity, it was rather hard to incorporate bigger changes, since everyone had to merge their local solution with the refactored one. We solved it by waiting for refactoring until most tasks of the sprint have been implemented to reduce the time people spend merging the two conflicting versions of the solution. After all, it was a good step to introduce the refactoring to the project, as it made the code more readible and maintainable.

# Sprint 4 Log

## Commitment
* The group attended the acceptance test and sprint retrospective for the last sprint.
* We estimated the story points for all of the features in sprint 4's backlog.

We committed to the following user stories

* ID 11. As a user I want to be rewarded with credits for my recycled items and see my result on a scoreboard so that I can compare my recycling to others.
* ID 12. Make an own file of the manual text input field and add navigation from barcode scanner into manual text layout and vice versa
* ID 13. Create a profile for each user - firebase?
* ID 14. As a user I want to have a visualisation of a seed that grows into a tree depending on my credit score history so that I can see my total amount of recycling
* ID 15. View categories - closest place where to recycle what. Not all can be recycled everywhere

*Name and ID of each feature*|*X hours*|*Member A: Y hours, Member B: Z hours*

## Reflections
Reflect on how the work worked.
This data will form the basis for your final reflection.
As the postmortem will be a writeup, it's fine to use shorthand notes, bullet list, and similar.
Keep within 1000-1500 words.

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

Reflect on the agile practice practiced:

- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- How did the practices interact?
  Did they complement or counteract each other?

- How efficient were the practices, given the time they took to use?

# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.
The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.

Considering the following:

- With regards to the agile practices, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?


# Project outcome
Document the project, for example using screenshots.
